Below is a rigorous and brutally honest code review of Draft 2 of your project, based on the provided codebase. This review focuses on functionality, error handling, performance, code quality, and maintainability, aiming to identify weaknesses and suggest improvements. Let’s tear it apart file by file.
analyze_query.go

Normalization Logic

    Problem: The normalization process relies on a long chain of strings.ReplaceAll calls. This is inefficient due to multiple string allocations and could fail for complex queries where replacement order matters (e.g., replacing "and and" before "and and or" might corrupt the query).
    Critique: It’s a brittle, ad-hoc approach that screams for a proper parser or lexer. The current method lacks robustness and scalability.
    Fix: Replace with a state machine or use a parsing library (e.g., go-peg or a custom lexer). This would handle edge cases better and improve performance by reducing allocations.
    Example Issue: Replacing "not not" with "and" is logically questionable—double negation typically cancels out, not converts to conjunction. This needs justification or correction.

OR Group Extraction

    Problem: The regex groupingRegex attempts to handle nested parentheses but fails for deeper nesting levels (e.g., ((a or b) and c)). It’s also fragile against malformed input.
    Critique: Clever but half-baked. It assumes well-formed queries and doesn’t validate placeholders (OR_<id>) against actual terms.
    Fix: Use a recursive descent parser for proper nested group handling. Ensure placeholder uniqueness with a more robust ID generation strategy.

Parsing Logic

    Problem: The word-by-word parsing with strings.Fields and flags like addToAnd is error-prone. It mishandles trailing operators (e.g., "word and") and assumes "or" is only in groups, which isn’t enforced.
    Critique: This feels like a hack job. Off-by-one errors and incorrect grouping are lurking here.
    Fix: Refactor into a token-based parser with explicit state transitions to avoid buffer mishandling.

removeSoloOrs

    Problem: The logic is unclear and ineffective. The regex doesn’t reliably identify solo "or"s, and the replacement logic mangles the query without clear intent.
    Critique: What even is this? It’s a mystery function that doesn’t do what it claims.
    Fix: Clarify the purpose (e.g., removing redundant "or"s?) and rewrite with explicit test cases to validate behavior.

removeDuplicates

    Problem: Simple but inefficient for large lists due to repeated appends. A map-based approach is used, but it could be optimized further.
    Critique: It works, but it’s not impressive. Performance could degrade with scale.
    Fix: Use a pre-allocated slice or a set library for better performance.

cache.go
File Handling

    Problem: defer ensures file closure, but error paths (e.g., in filepath.Walk) might skip closing if not handled explicitly. Truncation mode (os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY) wipes existing caches unexpectedly.
    Critique: Basic file I/O hygiene is missing, and the truncation behavior is a silent killer.
    Fix: Add explicit error checks before deferring and use append mode (os.O_APPEND) where appropriate.

ProcessOCRFile

    Problem: Returns nil for non-pages files, which is fine but risks missing critical data if directory structure assumptions change.
    Critique: Too rigid and silent about skips—logging or metrics would help.
    Fix: Log skipped files and validate directory assumptions dynamically.

AppendToCache

    Problem: Assumes append mode but conflicts with buildCache’s truncation. Offset calculations rely on Seek, which might be unreliable if file pointers shift.
    Critique: Inconsistent and fragile—cache corruption is a real risk.
    Fix: Standardize file modes across functions and use a more robust offset tracking mechanism (e.g., a separate index file).

buildIndex

    Problem: Reads entire postings into memory, sorts them, and writes bitmaps. This won’t scale for large datasets (e.g., gigabytes of OCR data).
    Critique: Naive and memory-hungry. It’s a toy implementation for small datasets.
    Fix: Use external sorting (e.g., merge sort on disk) and stream bitmaps incrementally.

config.go
Configuration Loading

    Problem: The logic is inverted—if check.File fails (file doesn’t exist), it tries to parse it anyway, which is nonsensical.
    Critique: A rookie mistake that could crash the app on bad config paths.
    Fix: Fix the condition: parse only if the file exists and is readable. Add a fallback to defaults if no config is found.

keys.go

    Problem: Constants are fine but lack organization as the list grows.
    Critique: It’s a dumping ground waiting to become unmanageable.
    Fix: Group related keys into structs or namespaces (e.g., ConfigKeys.Jaro.Threshold).

main.go
Cache Initialization

    Problem: Polling isCacheReady with time.Sleep is inefficient and reeks of race condition potential.
    Critique: Amateurish synchronization—why not use proper signaling?
    Fix: Use sync.Once or a channel to signal cache readiness.

Web Server

    Problem: Goroutine with wait group is solid, but shutdown could hang if webserver doesn’t exit cleanly.
    Critique: Graceful shutdown is half-implemented—needs more robustness.
    Fix: Ensure all goroutines (e.g., watcher) respect ctx.Done().

main_test.go
Test Cases

    Problem: Tests cover query parsing well, but assertions don’t fail the test—they just set ok. Coverage is narrow (only AnalyzeQuery).
    Critique: Testing is a facade—failures are silent, and critical paths are ignored.
    Fix: Use t.Fatal on assertion failures and expand tests to cover cache, search, and error scenarios.

matching.go
Algorithm Selection

    Problem: Switch statement is clean, but the default case silently returns false for unknown algorithms, hiding misconfigurations.
    Critique: Error handling is lazy—users won’t know why matches fail.
    Fix: Return an error or log unknown algorithms explicitly.

Configuration Access

    Problem: Pointer dereferences (e.g., *cfg.Float64(kJaroThreshold)) assume cfg is initialized, risking panics.
    Critique: Blind trust in globals is a disaster waiting to happen.
    Fix: Validate cfg initialization or pass it explicitly.

search_analysis.go
parseOrsRegexp

    Problem: Overly complex and debug-heavy (pp.Printf) for a simple ID extraction. Logic is convoluted and fragile.
    Critique: A mess of string manipulation that should be trivial.
    Fix: Simplify with direct map lookups and remove debug prints in production.

findOrsInNots / findOrsInAnds

    Problem: Regex-based logic is tangled and inefficient. Edge cases (e.g., unbalanced parentheses) aren’t handled.
    Critique: These functions are a maintenance nightmare—logic is buried in string hacks.
    Fix: Refactor into clear, testable helper functions with explicit state.

search.go
Error Handling

    Problem: Errors are wrapped with fmt.Errorf, losing context. Malformed cache data isn’t handled gracefully.
    Critique: Error handling is surface-level—deep issues will be opaque.
    Fix: Use %w for error wrapping and add validation for cache/index integrity.

Performance

    Problem: Loads entire index headers into memory and iterates bitmaps naively. Scales poorly with large datasets.
    Critique: A performance bottleneck masquerading as a search engine.
    Fix: Stream index data and optimize bitmap operations (e.g., precomputed intersections).

search_manager.go
Session Management

    Problem: Errors from search are silently ignored, leaving sessions in limbo. Channel management is solid but verbose.
    Critique: Error blindness undermines reliability—users won’t know why searches fail.
    Fix: Log or propagate errors and streamline channel setup.

types.go

    Problem: Structs are clear but undocumented, especially for complex types like SearchResults.
    Critique: Lack of comments makes it harder for new developers to jump in.
    Fix: Add godoc-style comments for all public types.

vars.go
Global Variables

    Problem: Heavy reliance on globals (e.g., searchManager, cfg) complicates testing and concurrency.
    Critique: A classic anti-pattern that sacrifices modularity.
    Fix: Pass dependencies explicitly or use a dependency injection framework.

watcher.go
File Watching

    Problem: Only handles directory creation—file changes or deletions are ignored. getNextPageID reads the entire index, which is slow.
    Critique: Barely functional for dynamic updates—misses half the use cases.
    Fix: Handle all fsnotify events and maintain a persistent counter for page IDs.

General Observations

    Error Handling: Inconsistent—some functions return errors, others log and swallow them. Pick a strategy and stick to it.
    Performance: Memory-heavy operations (e.g., loading full files) doom scalability. Stream or use a database.
    Testing: Woefully inadequate beyond query parsing. Critical paths like cache and search are untested.
    Documentation: Sparse—new developers will struggle to understand intent or behavior.

Brutal Summary
This codebase is a functional prototype but falls apart under scrutiny. analyze_query.go is a parsing disaster, cache.go and search.go are memory hogs, and error handling is a patchwork quilt. It might work for small datasets, but it’s nowhere near production-ready. The foundation is there—now rip out the hacks, optimize the bottlenecks, and test it until it bleeds.
Recommendations

    Refactor Query Parsing: Use a proper parser (e.g., ANTLR or a custom lexer) for reliability.
    Optimize Data Handling: Switch to streaming or a database (e.g., SQLite, Badger) for scalability.
    Standardize Errors: Adopt a consistent error strategy with full context preservation.
    Expand Testing: Cover all major functions with edge cases and failure modes.
    Document Everything: Add comments and docs to make the code self-explanatory.

This review is harsh but constructive—fix these issues, and you’ll have a robust system. Keep pushing!
